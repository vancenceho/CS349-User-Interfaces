### Explanations

Project root directory will be `a3/` as stated in requirements given.

#### Pre-Defined Categories & Items

As given in the requirement, sample shopping items have three properties: `name`, `quantity` & `category` and categories have three properties: `icon`, `name` & `color`. And it is given as per requirement below:

> _List of sample items_

```typescript
const sampleItems = [
  { name: "Milk", quantity: 4, category: "Dairy" },
  { name: "Yogurt", quantity: 1, category: "Dairy" },
  { name: "Pizza", quantity: 1, category: "Frozen" },
  { name: "Eggs", quantity: 12, category: "Other" },
  { name: "Olive Oil", quantity: 1, category: "Other" },
  { name: "Cheese", quantity: 1, category: "Dairy" },
  { name: "Burritos", quantity: 4, category: "Frozen" },
  { name: "Waffles", quantity: 2, category: "Frozen" },
  { name: "Bananas", quantity: 6, category: "Fruit" },
  { name: "Apples", quantity: 3, category: "Fruit" },
  { name: "Oranges", quantity: 3, category: "Fruit" },
];
```

> _A fixed set of categories_

```typescript
const categories = [
  { icon: "ü•õ", name: "Dairy", colour: `hsl(220, 75%, 75%)` },
  { icon: "üßä", name: "Frozen", colour: `hsl(220, 90%, 95%)` },
  { icon: "üçå", name: "Fruit", colour: `hsl(140, 75%, 75%)` },
  { icon: "üõí", name: "Other", colour: `hsl(0, 0%, 90%)` },
];
```

Some of the major challenges I have faced are included (but not all) as follows:

Initially, I was not able to achieve the result of getting 3 unique `sampleItems` and displaying them once the application has launched, in fact it did not show any `sampleItems` at all until I clicked the `undo` button. With a consult, I was able to figure out why I was unable to do so, it was because when I initialised my items, I did not get the `sampleItems` correctly, and with that I included the method `getRandomSampleItems` in my model so that it would do so and achieve the result.

Secondly, I also separated all my `css` styling onto `src/style.css`, however, some styling issues I ran into was that the result was not captured as desired and some would be overlooked due to the presedence of utilising it in `typescript` itself. Therefore, instead I only added `layouts` in my `css` script and all other `element` styling are inline with together with `typescript`.

Lastly, in `utils.ts` I created a function which would help create a `HTMLButtonElement` and return it with a given input of `text` and `width`, this helped me to reduce code since I would not be required to use `document.createElement` for every single `element` I would need and most of the required `buttons` would just be required to call the function `createButton` in `utils.py`.

Finally, I utilised co-pilot to help me structure, comment and document most of code in this project, so it would be easier for readibility and standardization.
